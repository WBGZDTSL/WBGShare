Welcome to my academic homepage! I am **Bangguo Wei (Aaron Wei)**, a Ph.D. candidate specializing in **Technological Economics** at Xiamen University. My research focuses on **energy economics, macroeconomics, and energy policy**, particularly the intersection of energy systems and economic development.

I am passionate about addressing challenges in energy transition, sustainability, and regional energy security. My work employs advanced econometric and computational methods, including **DSGE modeling** and **data analysis**, to provide insights into real-world energy and economic systems.

In addition to research, I enjoy reading, writing, and exploring the latest trends in technology and sports. This website serves as a platform to share my research, academic progress, and personal interests. I welcome constructive feedback and discussionsâ€”feel free to reach out via email.
