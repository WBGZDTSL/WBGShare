&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Today I listened to a song, EXO's 'Been Through'. I don't know when it started, but I have some self-awareness paranoia. When listening to music, I unconsciously generate discrimination based on differences, from blindly praising mainstream music to extreme enthusiasm for niche songs. In my hierarchical mind, there is ethnic emotional opposition which causes me to hold deep prejudices against Korean pop songs. Actually, this is a very arrogant attitude towards listening to music. Excessive self-reflection makes me feel conceited and think that more niche songs demonstrate individuality and narrow-minded patriotism will make me doubt, reject or even slander foreign music.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;My behavior is very ridiculous. Firstly, it's self-contradictory. I am enthusiastic about second-dimensional culture and listening to Japanese songs, but subconsciously resist Korean music. It seems that I am not a "loyal patriot", but rather binding my inner thoughts with the moral banner of "patriotism" and practicing differential discrimination through self-deception. The result is an inability to accept diverse cultural information and self-isolation. Moreover, in daily life, I may also hold high the banner of justice under the guise of morality while excluding others and envying their excellence. Secondly, it's a pathological herd mentality that leads me to pursue individuality but ultimately fall into mediocrity. Looking back on where my music discrimination comes from, I attribute it to being swept away by the complex network public opinion without firm principles myself; therefore what I call advocating individuality may be a powerless resistance to following the trend under massive information flow or even feeling guilty for not having true love - resulting in confusion and chaos in thought processes. Therefore, I have decided to rectify my thinking towards past mistakes.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As an honest child, art knows no boundaries. When I was young, I didn't have any sense of hierarchy and my feedback on information was more pure. I would speak candidly and truthfully - if it sounded good, then it was good. These past few days, I came across a great idea: follow your true inner thoughts. If it sounds good to you, keep it! If not, cross it out! This can also be applied to many things in life - comforting your own heart will make you feel much better.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Finally, I added this song to my Like List and told myself to let go of prejudices and take off the glasses of bias. The world will become much clearer.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Let's encourage each other.
