&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;When did I stop updating my Moments? Or to rephrase the question, why did I stop updating my Moments? This requires telling a story. One time, I used English in the caption of my Moment post because I thought that using poetic lines in English would be more romantic. Deep down, I have a bit of a bohemian and sentimental personality which planted a seed for a conversation with my father later on. During one conversation with him about the English captions on my posts, he complained: Why do you use English to express yourself on your Moments? Many relatives cannot understand it. Isn't this language discrimination towards our family members? Would they think that you are showing off by being obscure? At that time, I didn't understand his logic and unknowingly created social barriers through language obstacles. This incident left me with strong feelings; however, at first all I felt was anger and confusion from our conversation. My only response was to refuse sharing any emotional updates with elders - everyone around me became an enemy! The emotions generated from resistance were restless and impulsiveness is not always helpful when solving problems. Now as I recall this event again, once more asking myself why did I stop updating my Moments?, it's quite difficult to answer since it involves breaking down complex issues into their source problem: freedom versus constraint or free will.

## Balance between expressing independence and respecting others.
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I originally wanted to use the word 'balance', but considering the current level of narrow-mindedness, I need to continue to consider how to handle the relationship between the two. As an individual, I have free will and autonomy, can choose my own actions and express my own opinions. But at the same time, I am also constrained by society and culture, needing to follow certain moral and ethical guidelines while respecting the rights and dignity of others. My father mentioned "language discrimination", which aroused a sense of guilt in me towards others, prompting me to empathize with their reading experience. The moral constraints and ethical standards contained within this sense of guilt are what led me to close off my circle of friends as a "catalyst". However, it is also worth reflecting on how to find balance between freedom and constraint, as well as how to solve communication difficulties in intergenerational relationships in a more reasonable way. In the past, I chose the most foolish way out - not communicating at all. Although it was clear that listening, respecting understanding and tolerance could promote healthy development in relationships; however,I was held back by stubborn thoughts: if I complied with them then I would lose. This stemmed from arrogant bias rooted in uncertain beliefs; fearing cultural invasion taking over one's ideological high ground.The more firmly entrenched my obsession became about defending my three acres land,the more thoroughly defeated i became. The attention given by family members is also an important recognition.Why must social media narratives be so unrestrainedly disordered? Do i really need freedom or just emotional garbage under its name? Why should personal development be placed opposite familial love when coexistence should lead us towards greater freedom?

## Governance by dividing areas. 
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Faced with the above difficulties, my current solution is to stop emotional outbursts and cultural showing off in my circle of friends, and output more positive energy punctuated events, using social relationships to play a supervisory and promoting role. Of course, some more fanciful ideas and trivial daily life I prefer to put on other social platforms for easier access to positive feedback from within. In this way, it can be considered as a dual approach. That's all for today's writing because here is freer.
