# Go ahead No Back

From the last work record or year-end summary, the record book is afraid of early covered with electronic dust. Fatigue is only one of the reasons, but more is busyness, busy with livelihood, busy with trifles, busy with fantasies, busy with a thousand things.

In the past six months, I have basically been struggling with the past, spending most of my time on paper books, desperately trying to leave the past behind, and trying to become a false individual. In the impression of it, it should become, both strong and fragile, both brave and cowardly, like a pair of contradictions that will never stop, can not leave both and want to turn and repeat. The only thing worth remembering is running and reading, returning to the familiar and unfamiliar track and concentrating on reading a good book, are a kind of long-lost happiness.

After the explosion of reading last month, I recently became more interested in reading some loose literature, looking at the text, looking at the talk. Since the first time I read books in such depth, I have stayed in my college days. Still remember a street lamp dim evening self-study evening, looking at clean books slowly attached reading wrinkles, but do not know the knowledge engraved into the brain. Compared with the utilitarian reading in the past, the rush time of pursuing profits and examination scores has been replaced by a leisurely look, and he has become like the old man of the vegetable market, he will stroll around, not investigate deeply, especially comfortable. One hundred and eighty days on the pole head, some soup and water care down, after all, nothing. This does not also set off the sentence "because of the bamboo courtyard to meet the monk, steal the floating life of half a day of leisure" situation, this day passed a dull, particularly comfortable.

In my spare time, I am busy with two things: one is to start exercising and running, and the other is to build my personal website WBGShare.

### Training for a long run is to prepare for half a horse.

> This year, there is a whole horse challenge on the plan. In order to avoid the embarrassment of dying before starting, I decided to grind my patience and exercise firmly. Running is really a very pleasant sport, when the legs move up the moment, as if the whole world is coming to you. About running, I wrote a lot of words, such as fulfilling the promise of the whole horse, must write down the feeling of the moment is complete. Years are long, and now I understand more and more why Murakami Haruki is keen on running, this long sport is really worth waiting for.

### Personal website layout

> I have been planning a private page for a long time, and it is really a luxury of thought to delay it until today. The spirit of network sharing let me see a lot of spirit, so that I finally summon up the courage, determined to the future will be in my mind so seventy and eighty, all contribute to the Internet. The cabinet is temporarily stocked with personal CVS and some essays. The future plan is that the public number and the website will update the article in both directions. Personal projects and course preparation are only updated and announced on the website, and the public number is still pure, only as a small home of text.

I thought this year's accident was slow, but time is suddenly half a year. One day jogging downstairs, suddenly caught a glimpse of the bright sun on the traffic lights, like a cluster of fire falling, the crown of the tree under the sky, especially beautiful. Hefei, when you stop to look at it, it's really beautiful.

May the years be free, the breeze is always in, the green water is long flowing, and the personnel are safe.

To share with you.
